## 👋 Hey, I'm Artem

### ❗**First**, an update for people who know me
You used to know me as *610*, *x610*, or *x0610*, and other variations that were the consequences of a username field validation. - I decided to change to ❕`banesbyte`📌.

I'm also changing it everywhere I log in (if the service allows me to do it). Please pay attention when you assign me to a team or project.

### 💻 What I Do
I'm currently the **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** at **@NewlineAI**, where I lead an Automated Lending SaaS project that offers financial institutions custom and provision a platform that is linked to their website or domain, enabling their applicants to apply for a loan online (whether it is a personal loan, home equity or auto-refinance).

With more than **two decades** in the industry, I've tackled everything from **backend engineering** to **frontend development**, **DevOps**, and even **company policy writing**. I love building systems from scratch, using the latest frameworks and **cloud-native solutions**. My approach is backed by insights from leading industry experts and real-world case studies from **Meta, Amazon, Twitter**, and others.

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
Security isn't just a checkbox—it's a **core priority**. Since 2021, I've led **SOC 2** and **bank-specific audits**, ensuring compliance across infrastructure, cloud environments, and even employee workstations. This experience allowed me to grow in designing **fault-proof**, **secure-by-design** architectures that mitigate project risks at every stage of development. This process starts with the foundational elements of the source code, whether it is object-oriented programming (OOP) design or React components, and extends to building and configuring server infrastructure.

Beyond software, I focus on hardening Linux servers, implementing semi-custom or integrating cloud-based monitoring tools, and composing security policies that align with industry standards. They help you be prepared and minimize mistakes.


### 🏠 Beyond Work
Technology isn't just my job—it's my passion. I run a **Linux-based home server**, managing **virtual machines, Docker containers, and self-hosted services** that replace subscription-based platforms.

I’m also a **Gentoo enthusiast**, building systems from scratch—**custom kernel, initramfs, optimized package selection**—to maximize performance, security, and control over every installed component.

## 💬 Let's Connect
While I don’t have own public repos, I’m always looking for **new ideas and ways to contribute**. If you’re working on an **open-source project** and need help, feel free to **reach out**!
